        <p>Coco was borned on July 5, 2022. Because her Birthday was so close to the 4th of July, her name was initially America, before we named her. Her siblings were Stars(Lily), Anthem, and Justice(Harvey). There was another liter of puppies that were born a few days apart. Coco looked exactly like Camper even though they were from different liters.</p>

        <p>We picked up Coco on September 3, 2022.</p>

        <p>A few weeks prior to picking up Coco, we had visited the breeder. The breeder lived about an hour away and everyone in the family came. Coco was still 6 weeks old and was very small. Kai had grew a fond of Anthem, Coco's brother. The breeder told us that Anthem was still avalible and that we could get him for $500 off because he would be our second dog there. We didn't get him because Mari didn't allow us to. Anthem was adopted later to become a therapy dog. His name became Myson, but those plans were canceled.</p>

        <p>When we went to get Coco, it was only me and Toshi. I remember how the breeder handed me Coco was she went through the care package and everything else. We got McDonalds and we headed home.</p>

        <p>Once we got home, we put Coco inside of her cage and quickly started to potty train her. We kept her in the cage until she peeded where she was supposed to. We got a little impatient and let her out of her cage before she peed, but that resulted in her peeing on the carpet. I slept in a sleeping bag next to Coco that night. I tried to get her to eat her food my adding water to her food and hand feeding her but that only made my hands smell bad. When Coco pooped, I woke up from the smell of her poop. Toshi slept in the sleeping bag the next day.</p>

        <p>As Coco grew, we took her to a dog school where she learned some of the basic dog tricks and manners. We also took her to a trail. I went there for extra credit for science in 7th grade. We've taken to her to a tennis court so that she can run around freely, and to a trunck or treat with a costume on. We've also gotten her a pup cup at Starbucks. She has also made a few dog friends.</p>
        <p>Coco has now learned our routine and lives a happy life.</p>
