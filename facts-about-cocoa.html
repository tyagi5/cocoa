        <h2>Indoor Bathrooms</h2>
        <img class="day-right" src="images/coco-pooping.jpg" alt="coco pooping">
        <p>Coco likes to pee and poop outdoors now, but Coco is always able to do her buisness indoors. Coco has two places that she is able to pee and poops. There is one inside of her cage and also one right outside of her cage.</p>
        <img class="day-left" src="images/coco-poop-asking.jpg" alt="coco pooping">
        <p>Coco used to pee indoors all the time, but when Toshi started rewardingher for peeing and pooping outside, she started to prefer peeing and pooping outside. I like it when Coco pees outside because I don't have to clean up the trail of pee she leaves after she pees indoors. And Coco's poop really smells bad so it makes the whole house smell bad when she poops indoors.</p>

        <h2>Peanut Butter</h2>
        <img class="day-right" src="images/peanut-butter.jpg" alt="coco getting peanut butter">
        <p>Coco, just like mostly any other dog, loves peanut butter. I'm the only one who gives Coco peanut butter. I usually give her a tablespoon of Trader Joe's peanut butter in the evenings. Coco usually starts to drip drool on the ground or sofa when I am giving her peanut butter.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, I brush her teeth while giving her peanut butter, but that makes my fingers stink like peanut butter and beef toothpaste for days. Because Coco loves peanut butter, whenever I take out a small bowl and a small spoon, she starts wagging her tail knowing that she is about to get some peanut butter. I also put peanut butter in all of the cakes I have ever made for Coco so far.</p>

        <h2>Sleeping Positions</h2>
        <img class="day-left" src="images/upside-sleeping.png" alt="coco sleeping">
        <p>Coco may seemed like a normal dog that sleeps like a normal dog, however, Coco sleeps in a weird position every night. She sleeps in this position in the day too sometimes.</p>
        <p>We got this picture from a camera that we have, when we weren't home. The quality is not very good but you can see how Coco's paws are sticking out. Coco sleeps like this every night, and according to Toshi, the other half of Coco's body that we can't see is facing upwards.</p>

        <h2>Special Events</h2>
        <img class="day-left" src="images/birthday-hat.jpg" alt="coco's cake">
        <p>Special events are events like someone's Birthday, including Cocos, and Christmas. Sometimes I forget about celebrating Christmas with Coco so I celebrate New Year with her.</p>
        <img class="day-right" src="images/first-cake.jpg" alt="first cake for coco">
        <p>When I forget to bake Coco a cake, I always try to make up for it by giving her some extra peanut butter. I ususally always make Coco cake on her birthday, and on Christmass/New Year.</p>
        <img class="day-left" src="images/second-cake.jpeg" alt="coco and her second cake">
        <p>The first cake I made for Coco was a flat chunk of something in between dog cake and trash. It looked like an omlet, probably because I didn't put baking powder in it. I cut the piece in half and stacked them, then I covered it witha glob of yogert and added from fruits. I made a one with the fruits because I made the cake for Coco's first birthday. Coco ate the whole thing.</p>
        <p>The next cake I made was better. I made it for New Year because I didn't have time to make one for Christmas. I had learned from my mistake and I put baking powder in it. When I was done, I had two dog cakes that looked like muffins. I added a glob of yogert like last time and it was done. Coco seemed to enjoy this cake more than the last one.</p>

        <h2>Coco's Hanging Toys</h2>
        <p>This was Toshi's idea to make this. He hung the toys that we got so that Coco could play with it by herself.</p>
        <img class="day-right" src="images/hanging-toys.jpg" alt="coco's toys">
        <p>Although it might look unusual at first glance, Coco enjoys playing with this. I have taken a slow motion video of Coco ferociously attacking the wolf, which is her favorite. We got the wolf for sale after halloween. The witch next to it was also something we got for Coco after halloween. They both smell really bad from Coco's saliva.</p>

        <h2>The Green Carpet</h2>
        <p>The green carpet was originally bought so that we can practice putting and it is still used for that purpose. Coco has become a fond of this carpet and lies down on this carpet very oftenly.</p>

        </video>
        <p>I like to take videos of Coco running down the carpet in slow-motion. I make Coco sit and stay at the end. I go to the other end and call her to come, while I am filming the whole thing.</p>
