        <img class="hello" src="images/lily.jpeg" alt="lily yagi">
        <p>I live with my mom, dad, and brother, who I will introduce later in this page. I was born in December and I am 14 when I built this website. I play golf and I can speak Japanese because my parents are Japanese.</p>

        <h2>Kai Yagi</h2>
        <img class="hello" src="images/kai.jpg" alt="kai yagi">
        <p>Kai is my younger brother. He is three years younger than me and was born in Febuary. He also plays golf and can speak Japanese, even though I am better at his at both skills. Kai is short for his age and will always find a way to ruin your day.</p>

        <h2>Toshi Yagi</h2>
        <img class="hello" src="images/toshi.jpeg" alt="toshi yagi">
        <p>Toshi is my dad and he is over fifty (I forgot how old he was exactly) and his Birthday is in April. This website was actually a Birthday present for him. Toshi adores Coco and probably takes care of Coco the most. He is very hardworking and coaches us when we play golf. Of couse, we have an actual coach but Toshi also coaches us, even though he is not nearly as good as us.</p>

    <div class="day">
        <h2>Mari Yagi</h2>
        <img class="hello" src="images/mari.jpg" alt="mari yagi">
        <p>Mari is my mom. She usually makes meals, does the laundry, cleans the dishes, and does other house chores. She is also very lazy. Mari is horrible at golf, but she comes with us to drive or push our carts. Mari takes Coco on walks and Toshi tags along most of the times. When it is only Mari in the house, Coco will not hang around her, instead, Coco will simply enter her cage and sleep like Mari is not even there.</p>
