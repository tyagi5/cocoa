    <h1>A Day in Life</h1>
    <h3>of Cocoa the Dog</h3>

    <hr>

    <div class="day">
        <h2>Wake up</h2>
        <div>
            <p>When the first person in the house wakes up, Cocoa is usually already awake, sitting right outside of her bed, or poking her head out. Once they come downstairs to open her cage, she stretches and stumbles out of the cage, wagging her tail.</p>

            <p>Coco greets everyone differently in the mornings. Coco simply jumps up and wags her tail wildly for Toshi. For Mari, Coco pees. For me, Lily, Coco likes to lick my mouth and runs around me. For Kai, she lies down on her back.</p>
            <p>My dad lets her outside in our yard to let her do her buisness. When Coco comes back inside, she gets bits of our breakfast if she is lucky, which she usually is.</p>
        </div>
    </div>    

    <div class="day">
        <h2>Mornings</h2>
        <p>Because I have school on weekdays, I don't really know what Coco does after I leave. When I check the camera, I ususally see Coco sleeping on the bed I make for Coco out of my pajamas sometimes, or she simply sleeps on the pillow.</p>

        <p>When Toshi comes home after dropping Kai and I to school, he gives Coco some breakfast and he starts working. He works from home so he ususally doesn't work anywhere else. Coco sleeps on her bed in the office, next to my mom and dad.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">
        <h2>Afternoons</h2>
        <img class="day-left" src="images/coco-walk.JPEG" alt="coco at the park">
        <p>When my brother and I come back from school, Coco is sleeping on the sofa. She wags her tail and waits for us to come to her before she stretches and slides off of the sofa. After a while, my brother and I complete our homework we have for the day, or we go somewhere to practice golf.</p>
        <p>When it is only my mom, Mari, who is home, Coco sleeps inside of her cage. Mari usually takes her on a 30 minute walk, sometimes my dad tags along too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">
        <h2>Night</h2>
        <p>At night, Coco is always looking sleepy. Her eyes are droopy and she starts sleeping on the floor or on her bed in the office. After I go upstairs to my room, Coco is eager to start sleeping in her own bed. When my dad asks if Coco wants to sleep in Japanese, Coco rushes to her cage and waits for Toshi to reward her with a treat.</p>
        <img class="day-left" src="images/coco-sofa.JPG" alt="coco sleeping on the sofa">
        <p>She sleeps quietly through the night, waking up a few times to get a drink of water.</p>
    </div>
